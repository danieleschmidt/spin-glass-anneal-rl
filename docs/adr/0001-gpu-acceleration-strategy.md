# ADR-0001: GPU Acceleration Strategy for Spin-Glass Annealing

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The Spin-Glass-Anneal-RL framework requires high-performance optimization of large-scale Ising models with thousands to millions of spins. Traditional CPU-based annealing approaches suffer from:

1. **Sequential bottlenecks**: Monte Carlo updates are inherently sequential in nature
2. **Memory bandwidth limitations**: Accessing coupling matrices becomes a bottleneck
3. **Scalability constraints**: Problem sizes are limited by single-core performance
4. **Real-time requirements**: Applications require sub-second solution times

Modern GPUs offer massive parallelism (thousands of cores) and high memory bandwidth, making them attractive for accelerating annealing algorithms. However, GPU acceleration introduces challenges:

- Memory coalescing requirements for efficient access patterns
- Thread synchronization complexity for maintaining statistical correctness
- Limited per-thread memory and register constraints
- Need for specialized random number generation

## Decision
We will implement GPU acceleration using CUDA as the primary backend with the following design decisions:

1. **Parallel Tempering Architecture**: Use multiple GPU threads to run independent replica chains at different temperatures, enabling parallel exploration of the solution space.

2. **Block-based Spin Updates**: Organize spins into blocks that can be updated independently, allowing for massive parallelization while maintaining Monte Carlo correctness.

3. **Sparse Matrix Storage**: Use compressed sparse row (CSR) format for coupling matrices to minimize memory usage and improve cache efficiency.

4. **Custom CUDA Kernels**: Implement specialized kernels for:
   - Energy computation with efficient reduction operations
   - Spin updates with coalesced memory access
   - Temperature scheduling and replica exchange
   - Random number generation using CURAND

5. **Memory Management Strategy**:
   - Pre-allocate GPU memory pools to avoid allocation overhead
   - Use pinned host memory for efficient CPU-GPU transfers
   - Implement double-buffering for overlapping computation and communication

6. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Maintain CPU implementations for:
   - Systems without CUDA support
   - Problems too large for GPU memory
   - Debugging and verification purposes

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Performance**: 10-100x speedup for large problems compared to CPU implementations
- **Scalability**: Can handle problems with millions of spins within GPU memory limits
- **Parallel Tempering**: Natural fit for GPU architecture enables better exploration
- **Real-time Solutions**: Enables interactive optimization for time-critical applications

### Negative
- **Hardware Dependency**: Requires NVIDIA GPUs with CUDA compute capability 3.5+
- **Memory Constraints**: Problem size limited by GPU memory (typically 8-24GB)
- **Development Complexity**: CUDA programming requires specialized expertise
- **Debugging Difficulty**: GPU debugging tools are less mature than CPU counterparts

### Neutral
- **Platform Support**: Linux and Windows support through CUDA toolkit
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Requires keeping up with CUDA API changes
- **Testing Requirements**: Need GPU hardware for comprehensive testing

## Alternatives Considered

### OpenCL Backend
- **Pros**: Vendor-agnostic, supports AMD and Intel GPUs
- **Cons**: Lower performance than CUDA, less mature ecosystem
- **Decision**: Rejected due to performance requirements and NVIDIA's dominance in HPC

### CPU-only with SIMD
- **Pros**: No hardware dependencies, easier debugging
- **Cons**: Limited scalability, insufficient performance for real-time use
- **Decision**: Maintained as fallback but not primary implementation

### Quantum Hardware Integration
- **Pros**: Potential for quantum advantage on specific problems
- **Cons**: Current quantum annealers have severe connectivity and coherence limitations
- **Decision**: Supported as optional backend but not core dependency

### Multi-GPU Scaling
- **Pros**: Can handle even larger problems
- **Cons**: Communication overhead, complex load balancing
- **Decision**: Implemented as extension for future scaling needs
