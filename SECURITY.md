   - Use trusted CUDA installations
   - Validate GPU access controls

4. **Data Protection**:
   - Never commit API keys or credentials
   - Use environment variables for secrets
   - Implement proper access controls

### For Contributors

1. **Dependency Management**:
   - Regularly audit dependencies with `safety check`
   - Use exact version pinning for security-critical deps
   - Review dependency updates for security issues

2. **Code Security**:
   - Follow secure coding practices
   - Validate all inputs
   - Use parameterized queries
   - Implement proper error handling

3. **Secrets Management**:
   - Never hardcode secrets
   - Use proper secret management tools
   - Implement secret rotation

## Common Security Considerations

### CUDA and GPU Security

- **Driver Security**: Keep NVIDIA drivers updated
- **Memory Isolation**: Be aware of GPU memory sharing
- **Compute Sanitization**: Clear sensitive data from GPU memory

### Machine Learning Security

- **Data Privacy**: Implement differential privacy where needed
- **Adversarial Robustness**: Consider adversarial examples

### Distributed Computing

- **Network Security**: Use encrypted communications
- **Authentication**: Implement proper authentication
- **Authorization**: Use least-privilege principles

## Security Tools

We use various tools to maintain security:

- **Static Analysis**: Bandit for Python security linting
- **Dependency Scanning**: Safety for vulnerability checking
- **Container Security**: Docker image scanning
- **Code Review**: Mandatory security reviews for changes

## Incident Response

In case of a security incident:

1. **Immediate Response**:
   - Assess the scope and impact
   - Implement temporary mitigations
   - Notify affected users

2. **Investigation**:
   - Identify root cause
   - Determine affected systems
   - Document the incident

3. **Remediation**:
   - Develop and test fixes
   - Deploy patches
   - Verify effectiveness

4. **Communication**:
   - Notify users of the incident
