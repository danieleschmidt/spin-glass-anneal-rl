# Project Charter: Spin-Glass-Anneal-RL

## Project Overview

**Project Name**: Spin-Glass-Anneal-RL  
**Project Code**: SGARL  
**Charter Date**: August 2, 2025  
**Charter Version**: 1.0  

## Executive Summary

Spin-Glass-Anneal-RL is an open-source framework that revolutionizes complex optimization by combining reinforcement learning with physics-inspired spin-glass models. The project addresses the critical need for real-time solutions to multi-agent scheduling, routing, and coordination problems that are computationally intractable using traditional approaches.

## Problem Statement

### Current Challenges
Organizations across industries face increasingly complex optimization challenges:

1. **Multi-Agent Scheduling**: Coordinating hundreds of agents with conflicting objectives
2. **Real-Time Constraints**: Requiring solutions in seconds, not hours
3. **Scale Limitations**: Traditional solvers fail beyond 10,000 variables
4. **Domain Specificity**: Each problem requires custom solver development
5. **Solution Quality**: Heuristics often produce suboptimal results

### Market Impact
- **Manufacturing**: $50B+ lost annually due to inefficient scheduling
- **Logistics**: 30% of transportation costs from suboptimal routing
- **Cloud Computing**: 25% of resources wasted due to poor allocation
